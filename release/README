VCloudPlus supports windows running as service. It can be run in stand alone or cluster based on mysql community edition. 
And you can use other dbms with JDBC driver. If there is no db provided, all nodes will be run in stand alone mode. And all quartz configuration
should be kept same. Current version contains inner scheduler for extra management such as monitor db which will change running mode.
